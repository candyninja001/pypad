# PyPAD

A Python library that emulates multiple features of the mobile game Puzzle & Dragons.

## Install

I have no idea how you install the python library. Try Googling it. \# TODO

To update PyPAD with the latest game files (and initially download them) you must install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install).
